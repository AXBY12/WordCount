## Write a java program to count words in an input file and write the results to an output file.

The input file is a .txt file with each line a single word.
The words are not case-sensitive. That means, "Dictionary" and "dictionary" will be treated as the same word in the file.

Suppose the input file contains "hello" in 3 lines, "world" in 5 lines, and "java" in 6 lines. Your output will be a text file containing the following three lines:
hello 3
java 6
world 5
